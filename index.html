            My Dearest Mwangaza,
    
            As I pen down these words, memories of our shared past flood my mind, and I am overcome with a warmth that only your presence could ignite. The journey from second class to this moment has been nothing short of magical, and you, my love, have been the constant, the guiding star that lights my way.
    
            From the shy and introverted boy, I once was, to the man standing before you now, you've been my source of confidence and security. Your kindness, humor, and intelligence are the pillars that make you the perfect girl for me. I remember vividly the day we first met, a day etched in the tapestry of my heart.
    
            Your beauty, like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day, stopped the world around me. The image of that moment is forever imprinted in my soul. The letter you wrote to me, the first touch of your lips, and the sweetness of our secret meetings behind Grace's house – these are treasures that time cannot fade.
    
            Mwangaza, you hold an irreplaceable place in my heart. Your love has shaped the best moments of my childhood, and the echoes of our shared laughter resonate within me. The taste of your lips, the fragrance of your hair, the warmth of your embrace – these sensations are eternally engraved in the tapestry of my being.
    
            I confess, despite the years that have passed and the paths we've chosen, my love for you remains unwavering. I understand the barriers that life has placed between us – marriage and family. Yet, love, resilient and unyielding, refuses to be confined by such boundaries.
    
            Your happiness with your husband and daughter is my sincerest wish, and I harbor no desire to disrupt that joy. Still, I want you to know that I am here, steadfast and true, should you ever need me. Our history, filled with the innocence of childhood and the intensity of first love, is a story that could rival the most beautiful films.
    
            Mwangaza, you are my eternal girlfriend, and the love I bear for you transcends time and circumstance. It is a flame that continues to burn, casting its glow on the pages of our shared history.
    
            Forever Yours, Clesh
        </p>
